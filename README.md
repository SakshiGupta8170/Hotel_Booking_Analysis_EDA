# 📊 Hotel Booking Analysis Project

## 🧾 Overview
This project performs an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a hotel booking dataset. The goal is to uncover patterns in customer behavior, cancellations, revenue, room preferences, and other insights to help hotel businesses make data-driven decisions.

## 📁 Dataset Description
The dataset consists of **119,390 records** with **32 columns**, covering bookings made for two hotel types:

- 🏨 **City Hotel**
- 🏖️ **Resort Hotel**

### Key Features:
- Booking behavior (`is_canceled`, `lead_time`, `arrival_date`)
- Guest demographics (`adults`, `children`, `babies`, `country`)
- Room and stay details (`reserved_room_type`, `assigned_room_type`, `adr`, `special_requests`)
- Financial and channel information (`adr`, `deposit_type`, `distribution_channel`)

---

## 🔧 Data Preprocessing
- ✅ Removed **duplicate rows**
- 🔧 Handled **missing values**:
  - Filled `agent` with 0
  - Filled `country` with `'Other'`
  - Dropped `company` due to 94% nulls
- 🧮 Created new features:
  - `total_stays_in_nights`
  - `total_guests`
  - `revenue = adr * total_stays_in_nights`
